# Just-A-Thought
A random thought sharing app.

## Purpose
The purpose of this web application is to demonstrate my ability to create basic full-stack applications. The completion of this application shows that I am able to use NodeJS/ExpressJS to create a RESTful API and combine the technologies with Mongoose to provide CRUD functionality for a MongoDB database. It also shows that I am able to use Bootstrap and HTML to quickly create clean looking views/templates and use CSS to further customize the theme and enhance responsiveness of the site. Additionally, it shows I am able to use AngularJS to load templates into the view (and dynamically load data into the templates where necessary) and also send data to the server and retrieve data from it.

## Functionality
The application allows users to enter an alias, post a random thought and provide hashtags related to the thought, if they wish. The users can browse thoughts containing any given hashtag and like/dislike other users' thoughts. Users do not have to create an account in order to post thoughts, this is partly because I believe that use of apps like this is best left anonymous. But also because I do not wish to be in charge of storing people's email addresses or any other identifying information in case they share something personal and someone cruel sets out to uncover their identity.

## Expansion
It is unlikely that new functionality will be added to this, as its primary purpose is to serve as a full-stack application for my web development portfolio. But there is the potential for features to be created/added such as a swear filter, moderator accounts and report buttons on each thought post. The ability for users to attach an image to their thought could also be added. But again, this is primarily to be used to show to prospective employers and the last thing I want is for them to open the app and see some pictures of cute kittens, followed by a meme of Hitler captioned with "If you can't handle me at my worst, then you don't deserve me at my best" (this is the internet, after-all).
